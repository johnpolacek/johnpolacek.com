At the start of each year, I usually write out a list of things I plan on trying to accomplish professionally. For the last couple of years, these lists have mostly consisted of technologies and programming languages I wanted to learn. This year is different. I feel like I&rsquo;ve got a pretty good grasp of a variety of languages and web development overall. So instead, my list is composed of one item (and it also applies to my personal/family life as well). **_Do Cool Stuff._**
