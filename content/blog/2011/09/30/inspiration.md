There are so many great sources of web design and development inspiration out there. Below are some of my favorites.

<a href="http://onepagelove.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>One Page Love</strong></a>  
My current favorite. A collection of beautifully designed one-page websites. Really enjoy using and building these.

<a href="http://webtypographyforthelonely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Web Typography For The Lonely</strong></a>  
The best of what&rsquo;s happening in modern web typography.

<a href="https://aneventapart.com/news/post/the-10k-apart-responsive-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>10K Apart &#8211; Responsive Edition</strong></a>  
These entries to the annual 10K Apart competition are not only highly optimized (need to be less than 10K to enter), they all implement responsive web design.

<a href="http://sixrevisions.com/design-showcase-inspiration/30-inspiring-about-me-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>30 Inspiring &lsquo;About Me&rsquo; Pages</strong></a>  
Creating an &lsquo;About Me&rsquo; page is a perfect way for someone new to web development to get started.
