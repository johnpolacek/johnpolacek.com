I’ve made updates to <a href="http://code.johnpolacek.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my code library</a> (performance improvements mostly) and moved it from svn/google code to <a href="https://github.com/johnpolacek/code.johnpolacek.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a>. I’ve had enough of svn and have been wanting to try git out for a while now. I’ll be sharing the source for a couple of my app projects there as well.
