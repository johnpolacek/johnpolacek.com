I just set up [my Github homepage][1]. I&rsquo;ve been seeing all these people setting up cool [project pages][2] and wanted to get in on it.

I&rsquo;ve been posting code to Github for quite some time (and Google Code before that). I made the switch to Git from SVN awhile back. For my own personal workflow, where I mostly code solo, there isn&rsquo;t too much benefit for Git over SVN. However, Git does have one killer feature, and that is Github.

Github is a tremendously useful site. Between that and StackOverflow, it has never been a better time to be a developer. Here are the things I love about Github:

  * **The code.** Oh. My. God. Frameworks, utilities, helpful gists, apps, etc. etc. So much goodness on there.
  * **The people.** Who isn&rsquo;t on Github these days. And you can interact with them all. Ask questions, make pull requests, fork their stuff. In my inbox, I have messages from [Scott Jehl][3], [Nathan Smith][4], [Shi Chuan][5] and [Paul Irish][6]. Mother F&rsquo;ing Paul Irish. How cool is that?!
  * **Free Code Storage.** Oh yeah, and you can put all your code up there. (Well at least the public stuff, for private I use [bitbucket][7])
