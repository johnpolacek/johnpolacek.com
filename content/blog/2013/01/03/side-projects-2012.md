My list of in-my-spare-time projects that I’ve released last year:

[Scrollorama][1]
  
[What The Heck Is Responsive Web Design][2]
  
[Scrolldeck][3]
  
[Scrollorama2: SuperScrollorama][4]
  
[Are You A Brogrammer?][5]
  
[BigVideo.js][6]
  
[Channel of Awesome][7]
  
[Responsivator!][8]
  
[stacktable.js][9]

And it is looking very good for 2013 (already got it started with [controldeck.js][10]). I’m lucky to get to work with a bunch of talented devs, and the plan is to join forces to pull off some cool stuff. Stay tuned.
