**1/15/2013 Update &#8211; Another SuperScrollorama site, [Zipper Galleria][1] has won an [Awwward][2]**

The <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awwwards</a> are awards for design, creativity and innovation on the Internet, which recognize and promote the best web designers in the world. Every day, I take a look at their <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awwward-winning site of the day</a>. It was really exciting to <a href="http://rule-of-three.co.uk/we-won-an-awwward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see UK Copywriting company Rule of Three win</a>, not just because they have a <a href="http://rule-of-three.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice site</a>, but because they are using <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperScrollorama</a>.

There have been a lot of great sites popping up these days that are incorporating <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperScrollorama</a> or <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperScrollorama</a>. It is especially cool to see it spread to other countries, like on <a href="http://www.theblacksparrow.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Black Sparrow</a>, a restaurant website in New Zealand. It is even being used on on websites where I don&rsquo;t speak the language, like <a href="http://www.landeenjob.be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Land Een Job!</a>. Luckily there is Google Translate!
