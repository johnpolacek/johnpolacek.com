This was another Techweek Lab Coat Series Session that covered various new prototyping tools. There is a lot of activity in this are, with new products coming to market every 2-3 months. [Mark Rickmeier][1] covered a few of the newer, better ones. 

The first was [POP (Prototyping on Paper)][2] where you can take pictures of hand-drawn wireframes and actually stitch together an interactive app prototype. If you want to prototype actual apps, you can use Testflight to push prototype apps directly to phones. Airplay lets you project an app demo from a phone to an Apple TV. [Noteboard][3] is a dry erase board that folds up (portable whiteboards that are about the size of an iPhone)
