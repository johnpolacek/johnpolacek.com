My slides from [my Techweek Chicago presentation][1] are going to be published live (wifi permitting) during the talk. Once that happens, you can check them out at [johnpolacek.github.io/open-source-for-fame-and-fortune][2] . The presentation was built on top of a new html presentation framework I just started working on. It is called TweenDeck, and it is built on top of the [Greensock Animation Platform][3]. If you know what you are doing in [Greensock][3], and understand how to build a [Timeline animation][4], then you will find it super easy to use. It is a bit time intensive, as you have to handcode a lot of animations, but what you wind up with is a pretty slick preso. In addition to building presentations, I could see it being used to create things like product demos and animated stories in the browser.

As a followup, below are some additional resources related to what I talked about in the session.
