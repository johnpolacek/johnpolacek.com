I&#8217;ve decided to make it into a thing and put it out there. So I present to you&#8230; [chicagotechevents.com][1]

I managed to have some fun building it too. It was my first time using [Twig templates][3], and really liked it. I expect Iâ€™m going to be using that on a lot of things in the future. Also, I am trying out a couple [AWS products][4]. I built the backend on [DynamoDB][5] because why not. I made a simple admin page for adding the events to DynamoDB. Every day, a CRON job runs that goes through the events and makes a JSON file with all the data, and puts it onto [S3][6]. When you go to [chicagotechevents.com][1], it is loading that JSON file and smushing it together with a Twig template. Nice and simple.

I am also using [Amazon SES][7] for the first time for sending out the email newsletter, because the price was right and integration was easy (so far).
