Some key points from the panelists ([Natalia Oberti Noguera][1], Rick Murray, [Justyn Howard][2] and [Brad Burke][3]</p> 

  * People don’t relate to companies, they relate to people.
  * If you have a company account, also have a personal account.
  * Some companies are using Twitter as a primary customer interface.
  * Don’t chase or place too much importance on a single negative tweet.
  * Having a 5-minute response time is one thing, but having a good response is better.
  * Don’t just respond with a link, taking extra time to answer a question will create a better interaction.
  * Storytelling is compelling (more compelling perhaps that retweet to win a prize).
  * [Storify][4] is a great tool.
  * The [Advanced Search][5] in Twitter is a nice tool too.
  * [Natalia Oberti Noguera’s][6] primary advice: Be Helpful
