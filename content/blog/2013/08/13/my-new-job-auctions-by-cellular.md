I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve been hired by [AuctionsByCellular (ABC)][1] as Lead Web Developer. ABC is an exciting new company that uses [people-powered technology][2] to help charities improve their fundraising efforts. Not only will I get to do what I love (write lots of code), my efforts will actually help improve the world, so how awesome is that!

Not only have they built a great tech platform (which I will be helping build out), ABC has great event staff that help run the event. The way it works is that attendees of the charity event get a text when the auction starts, then bid on items from their phones (or can go to one of the ABC staff who have iPads). Charities [love it][4]!

If you are curious to hear more about my new place, there have been [lots of articles about ABC][5] in the press lately, including [this article featuring my friend (and ABC CEO) Jim Alvarez][6].

If you or someone you know is with a charity that can benefit from using ABC, please get in touch:
