Every year Google makes its big announcements at its [Google I/O event][1]. This year, the [Chicago HTML5 User Group][2] hosted a [watch party][3]. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to attend, but it sounds like it was a great time. They put on a lot of [great events][4], so if you’re in the Chicagoland area, you should definitely [sign up][5].

Here’s some of the big things that came out of Google I/O 2013:

**New Google+: Stream, Hangouts, and Photos**
