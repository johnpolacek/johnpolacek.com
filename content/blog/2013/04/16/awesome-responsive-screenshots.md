<img src="/img/blog/2013/04/responsive-screenshot.png" alt="responsive-screenshot" width="665" height="292" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1249" srcset="http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/responsive-screenshot.png 665w, http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/responsive-screenshot-300x131.png 300w, http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/responsive-screenshot-500x219.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" />

Below is a quick, simple way to generate screenshots of Responsive websites <a href="http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Responsivator.png" rel="lightbox[1248]">like this</a> (note: link is a big image, so it will take a while to load).

Go to the <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/Responsivator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsivator website</a> and enter the url of the website. Check the hide header option. This will generate you a url like this: <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/Responsivator/?site=gesture.com.com&header=hide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://johnpolacek.github.io/Responsivator/?site=gesture.com&header=hide</a>

Go to that url and use the [Capture Webpage Screenshot Chrome Extension][1] to take a screenshot. After a few seconds of processing time, you will have yourself a nice looking screen capture of your website across a variety of screen sizes (like <a href="http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Responsivator.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="lightbox[1248]">this</a>).

If youâ€™d like to customize the screen sizes, click the customize button in <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/Responsivator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsivator</a> and adjust the frames settings</a>

_Note: This article has been updated since originally published. The tool previously recommended is no longer available (as you may notice in the comments)._
