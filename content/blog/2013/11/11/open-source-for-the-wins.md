So much inspiring stuff out there to be found. What do all these beautiful and often amazing award-winning websites have in common? They all use open source projects from Github and elsewhere. As someone who releases open source, it is thrilling when you view the source of one of these sites and see your own code mixed in there. 

So I want to thank all the people out their using my code to help them power their creations. Knowing that my projects are being used by talented people all over the world is both tremendously motivating and also a bit mind-blowing.

_Here’s a list of some of the latest award-winning sites that use my open source stuff:_

## Sites using [SuperScrollorama][1] (and also [Greensock Animation][2]):

Lastly, a special shoutout to [Alexander Prinzhorn][23] and his magnificent [skrollr][24] project. Many a time I have viewed source of a really cool scrolling website in hopes that it was using my code, only to discover that it is a Skrollr site. At which time, I clench my fist and shout “Skrollr! You got me again, haha.”
