Today was my first day at the Adobe MAX conference in Los Angeles. The full conference officially starts tomorrow, but they had all day pre-conference sessions going today.

Stuff Iâ€™ve learned:

  * Adobe is launching a new product, <a href="http://rome.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rome</a>. 
  * Adobe Bridge is not the performance hog it once was (especially when you adjust the default image rendering). Worth another look.
  * Bunch of new Adobe Illustrator Techniques (Perspective, Draw Inside, Align To Pixel, Artboards, Recolor Artwork Button).
  * Bunch of new Photoshop Techniques (Content Aware Fill, Refine Edge/Refine Mask, Save Selection, Mixer Brush, Puppet Warp).
  * Adobe has a feature request form at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform&#038;promoid=EWQQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>.
  * InDesign can do a pretty good job at creating basic interactive content (as a swf).
  * Flash Catalyst is meant to use in a workflow with Flash Builder (Flex). There is no workflow for it to work with Flash Professional.
