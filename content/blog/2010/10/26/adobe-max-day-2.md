Stuff I learned on day 2:

  * Keep up with the latest stats with data collected from Adobe’s SiteCatalyst at netaverages.adobe.com
  * Adobe’s <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/digitalpublishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Publishing Suite</a>, the technology behind the digital publishing efforts of Wired and other Condé Nast publications, is now available as a beta.
  * It is possible to use a mobile device as a peripheral to your desktop. For example, during Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch’s keynote, he showed a demo using an android tablet as a painting tool for photoshop.
  * Adobe <a href="http://tv.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air for TV</a> provides yet another outlet for using your ActionScript skills.
  * Adobe has purchased <a href="http://www.day.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Day Software</a> to use as its official CMS of choice for its development tools and workflow. Worth taking a look.
  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/inmarket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InMarket</a> is Adobe’s solution to help developers streamline app publishing and distribution to multiple stores (except Apple’s obviously).
  * Adobe projects that the Flash Player will be installed on 53% of mobile devices in 2012.
  * As part of their Flash Platform Services, Adobe has developed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/services/social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Social service</a>, powered by <a href="http://www.gigya.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigya</a>, that enables developers to easily integrate with social media like Facebook, Twitter, and others with their applications
  * <a href="http://www.flashmobileblog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlashMobileBlog</a> is a great place for keeping up with the latest with the Flash Player on Mobile Devices.
  * Todd Anderson has developed a nice set of AS3 components for mobile named as3flobile.
  * A <a href="http://gskinner.com/talks/quick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wide array of techniques for optimizing performance</a> for Flash from <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Skinner</a>, including a really nifty tool for analyzing code from Adobe called FlexPMD.
  * <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tweenlite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Jack Doyle (Greensock)</a> is as nice in person as he is virtually.
