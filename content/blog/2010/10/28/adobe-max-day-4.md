Stuff I learned on the final day of Adobe MAX:

  * Dreamweaver CS5 has some <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/whatsnew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool new features</a> and worth a look even for web devs who prefer text editors.
  * Adobe is developing a case study project for Citrus Cafe, a fictional restaurant, to demonstrate its methodologies for web development. Read <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/dw_html5_pt1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this web development tutorial</a> to check it out.
  * CSS3 Transforms take advantage of mobile device hardware acceleration, where javascript does not.
  * Adobe is still trying to figure out best practices for HTML5 mobile web development, and therefore, everybody is. All this stuff is new, and everybody is scrambling to figure out the best ways to implement the latest web technologies.
  * JavaScript has an Image class for loading images.
  * An up-until-now top secret product that Adobe developing is named Muse. It aspires to be a tool for designers to build complete websites, including CMS support, wireframing, custom skinnable widgets (e.g. slideshows, accordions, google maps) and more. It will support the use an external asset library. For example, you could link to a high res image being used in a print ad, and when you export the project, Muse will format and optimize the image. The tool will require the user to host on the Adobe Business Catalyst hosting platform.
  * “Automagic” seems to be the new buzzword of the moment.
  * In Flash Builder, pressing Option-Command-Down while a piece of selected code, duplicates that code beneath the selected code. Awesome.
  * The HTML5 Canvas element is pretty limited in what it can do. Definitely requires the use of framework(s) to accomplish anything cool without wanting to jump out a window.
  * <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnlindquist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">John Lindquist</a> knows how to put together a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnpolacek/status/28924373806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">great lunch lineup</a>.
  * If you are a Flash Developer and you want a good resource for info about HTML5 Canvas, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/parkerkrhoyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Kevin Hoyt</a> is your man.
  * I don’t know if Flex is a technology I really want to use as a developer, but there sure are some pretty cool things that you can do with it.
  * I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/parkerkrhoyt/status/27402934130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">wasn’t the only one</a> whose WordPress site got hacked last week.
  * Google is launching a <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Web App Store</a> that will sell flash web apps. 95% of the sale price goes to the developer (vs. 70% on Apple’s store).
