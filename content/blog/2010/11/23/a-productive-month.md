In the last month, Iâ€™ve&#8230;

  * Started using <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoaderMax</a> for all my runtime loading in flash.
  * Created my first cron job.
  * Completed my first jQuery-only job at my work.
  * Learned a whole lot more about php, MySQL, curl and a little bit more javascript.
  * Figured out some ways to better secure a WordPress site.

So yeah, a productive month to say the least.
