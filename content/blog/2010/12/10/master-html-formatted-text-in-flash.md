My first tutorial, <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/design/master-html-formatted-text-in-flash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master HTML Formatted Text in Flash</a>, has been published to <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ActiveTuts+</a>, the best website there is for Flash tutorials. Hopefully some people can benefit from some of the pain I have experienced in working with HTML-formatted, CSS-styled text in Flash.
