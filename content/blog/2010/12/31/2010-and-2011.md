Looking back at my year in 2010, here are some things that stand out (professionally that is):

  * Organized my various AS3 classes into library and put it up online at <a href="http://code.johnpolacek.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code.johnpolacek.com</a>, with a repo at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/contentdisplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google code</a>.
  * Finished the artwork for Missile To The Moon (should be coming out in Spring 2011)
  * Got published on <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/design/master-html-formatted-text-in-flash/" target="_blankl">Activetuts+</a>. 
      * Rebuilt [johnpolacek.com][1] with my own custom HTML5 WordPress theme
      * Attended Adobe Max, and wrote about it <a href="http://draftfcblog.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
      * Built my first iPhone/Android app, Touch The Trend, and in doing so&#8230;
      * Created my first PHP/MySQL backend
      * Set up my first cron job</ul> 
    In 2010, I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted to accomplish and learn. Looking forward to 2011, the picture isn’t as clear. With all the exciting things happening in web development, I probably won’t be undertaking any major comic book projects. The pace of innovation on the web is ever-increasing, so it is a bit difficult to predict what the trends will be and what exactly I’ll be working on. Mobile? Apps? HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript development? Cool Flash stuff? Expanding my PHP and MySQL knowledge? Probably all that and more.
