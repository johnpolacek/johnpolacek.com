Wow, what a great few weeks I&rsquo;ve had.

Things started off when on New Year&rsquo;s Day I posted my [Scrollorama plugin][1] to Hacker News and a couple other places. To my great surprise, it shot up to #1 on HN and stayed on the front page for pretty much the whole day.

<img src="/img/blog/2012/01/hackernews_top.png" alt="" title="hackernews_top" width="475" height="194" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-426" srcset="http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hackernews_top.png 475w, http://johnpolacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hackernews_top-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" />

Then it started showing up on Twitter, and got a lot of great compliments from people I really respect. I even got a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnpolacek/status/153638712687869952" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">favorited by Paul Irish</a>. The fun continued when Scrollorama got featured in dailyjs and [The Verge][2] and softpedia.

Then, my [&ldquo;What The Heck Is Responsive Web Design?&rdquo; slides][3] got posted to Hacker News, then linked to by a number of people, including Mr. [HTML5 For Web Designers][4] Himself, [Jeremy Keith][5].

Finally, to top it all off, my work has been featured across JavaScript Weekly, The JavaScript Show and HTML5 Weekly, all in the same week.

Of course, I also have to say that [Grant][6], my new baby boy, has been absolutely great. No colic, sleeps and eats well, and is just a pleasant baby. So, professionally and personally, it has been a really great time for me. Thanks everybody!
