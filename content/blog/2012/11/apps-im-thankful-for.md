I&rsquo;ve recently acquired both a new Macbook Pro and iPad. When you get new tech, it is an ideal time for tech spring cleaning, where you re-assess all your old ways of doing things in light of new capabilities provided by your shiny new toys. I cleared out a bunch of old apps that I never use anymore, and also took a few minutes to make a list of the ones that I use all the time.

I am in an interesting spot, because I have an Android phone (Droid 4) and I have a preference for the Google ecosystem over Apple&rsquo;s. My wife is also on Android and has a Windows laptop. Our list of tech is:

  * **New Macbook Pro (home)** &#8211; Shared with my wife. Used for personal stuff like family home movies, photos, music, etc.
  * **Macbook Pro (work)** &#8211; All my work projects.
  * **Droid 4** &#8211; My phone
  * **Samsung Something** &#8211; Wife’s phone.
  * **iPad 3** &#8211; Just won this at a Yahoo! agency event. I primarily use it as our video camera and for occasional internet browsing while watching TV.
  * **Motorola Xoom** &#8211; A gift from a client, this is primarily an Angry Birds console for my son.
  * **Logitech Squeezebox** &#8211; A wireless audio system (we have 3 players in 3 different rooms in the house that are synchronized). Unfortunately, it looks like the Squeezebox line of products <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33199_7-57519226-221/logitech-leaves-squeezebox-fans-wondering-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been discontinued.</a>

Here&rsquo;s a list of all the apps/websites that I&#8217;m most thankful for (not including ones for my job):

  * **<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a>** &#8211; My browser of choice and, of course, the dev tools are phenomenal. Since we share a computer, my wife uses Firefox so we can keep all our accounts straight.
  * **<a href="https://mail.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gmail</a>** &#8211; Is there even another email client that comes close?
  * **<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Reader</a>** &#8211; My RSS feed is how I stay up-to-date on the rapidly changing world of web technology,
  * **<a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>** &#8211; I use this to organize my projects and my life.
  * **<a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastPass</a>** &#8211; So many passwords, so little space in my brain. This is what we use to keep ‘em straight.
  * **<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>** &#8211; I use this to transfer pics and video from my iPad to the Macbooks
  * **<a href="http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=1304818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google+ Instant Upload</a>** &#8211; We have this on both our phones. Every time we take a photo or video it gets instantly uploaded to my Google+ account.
  * **<a href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandora</a>** &#8211; We have Pandora set up with our Logitech Squeezebox audio system to play music at home, as well as one our phones. We have a paid Pandora One account so we don’t get commercials.
  * **<a href="http://www.doggcatcher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doggcatcher</a>** &#8211; A podcast app for Android, this makes my hour-long commute to/from work enjoyable. Not sure if this is currently the best one on the market, as I purchased it a long time ago before there were many Android apps available.
