Some great rules to follow when writing, from <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this George Orwell essay</a>:

  1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
  2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
  3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
  4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
  5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
  6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
