One of the best sessions I&rsquo;ve had so far was CSS For Grown-Ups by Andy Hume.

Some of the highlights:

  * CSS is &lsquo;Constraint Programming&rsquo;.
  * Obsession with eliminating &lsquo;classitis&rsquo; is outdated and not good practice.
  * The idea of doing a redesign without touching the markup is a myth.
  * Apply OOP principles to CSS. For example, extend your semantic classes, such as .promo-box&#8211;light (double dash indicates dependence).
  * Optimize for change! Website maintainability is supremely important.
  * Using semantic class names is emerging as new best practice.
  * <a href="https://github.com/ahume/selector-queries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selector Queries</a> &#8211; Andy&rsquo;s JS solution for adjusting elements based on width using a data-squery attribute and adding classes.
  * Use surgical layout helpers, eg .gutter-left, .gutter-right in div containers.
  * New code practice: For sprite sheets, use <a><i class=&#8221;icon icon-comment&#8221;>
  * Don&rsquo;t style pages, style modules.
  * Do styleguides in code, ala <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Bootstrap</a> or Paul Robert Lloyd&rsquo;s Styleguide.
  * Style guides are a great opportunity to bring design and dev together.
