A few months ago, <a href="http://darcyclarke.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darcy Clarke</a> posted a collection of <a href="https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Front End Developer Interview Questions</a> to Github. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-kraska-38383815/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another dev</a> at work shared them with me a couple weeks ago. I took a look at them and decided they would be a great knowledge check. For some questions, I knew the answer straight away. For others I knew what the question was getting at, but had a hard time translating the answer from being understood logic in my brain to words. Other questions referred to a concept I was familiar with, but didn&rsquo;t know or remember the terminology for. Going through these was a great review for me. I looked up and read about all of the topics, even the ones I knew pretty well.

Personally, I think it works better as a Front End Developer Trivia Quiz, as I don&rsquo;t think some of the questions are particularly vital for a Front End Dev job candidate to know off the top of their head. When I interview people, I&rsquo;m not looking to ask a lot of &lsquo;gotcha&rsquo;-type questions. Instead, I ask more about what the person is into, their comfort level doing certain kinds of projects and take a look their code (then ask questions based off of that). Perhaps this questionnaire was intended to be for a written response interview, in which case I think it would work pretty great.

Take a go at it, and when you finish, you can read my responses to all the questions on my <a href="https://github.com/johnpolacek/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Front End Dev Questions Github fork</a>.
