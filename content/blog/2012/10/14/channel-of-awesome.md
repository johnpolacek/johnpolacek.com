Like I imagine is the case for most large ad agencies, we have a number of large flat screen tv&rsquo;s in various places <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tour-draftfcbs-gigantic-chicago-office-building-2012-4?op=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around the office</a>. They show things like CNN, our creative reel, etc. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what I&rsquo;d like to see on these screens. What I&rsquo;ve come up with is the <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/channel-of-awesome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Channel of Awesome</a> &#8211; a collection of video clips featuring modern technology that I consider mindblowing. The kind of stuff that makes you feel like you&rsquo;re living in the future.

What about other people who might want to share their own collections of amazing videos? Well, I&rsquo;ve open sourced the project on <a href="https://github.com/johnpolacek/channel-of-awesome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> and have <a href="https://github.com/johnpolacek/channel-of-awesome#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made it fairly easy</a> for anybody to create their own Channels of Awesome. Do you like cat videos? Just go onto YouTube and Vimeo, gather the video ID&rsquo;s of the best cat videos the internet has to offer and create a link like this:

Voila, you now have a Channel of Awesome for cats!
