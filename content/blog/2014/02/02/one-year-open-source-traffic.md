Well, today I decided to take a look at a year’s worth of traffic, and I am absolutely blown away.

In one year, there were 743,557 unique visitors to my various open source projects. [SuperScrollorama][2] was the most popular with 487,475 pageviews. Unbelievable! And I noticed that I wasn&#8217;t even tracking [Responsivator][3] or [BigVideo.js][4], so it was undoubtedly a lot higher, probably over a million. Amazing.
