[Git aliases][1] have been around for a long time, but in case you don’t know about them, they allow you to create shortcuts for just about any git command or sequence of commands that you can think of. Beyond just the convenience of less key presses, you can use to streamline your workflow by sequencing longer sets of commands that are hard to remember. Here is a nice intro article on Git aliases: [Streamline your git workflow with aliases][2].

Wouldn’t it be fun if today was Share Your Git Aliases Day? Taking a look at [other people’s .gitconfig files][3] can give you an insight into how they work and give you ideas for improving your own workflow. For example, check out [Must Have Git Aliases: Advanced Examples][4]. Mathias has a really popular .gitconfig in his dotfiles collection that has almost 10K Github stars: <https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig>.
