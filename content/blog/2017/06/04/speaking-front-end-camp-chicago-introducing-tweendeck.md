Over the weekend, I gave a talk titled &ldquo;Rethinking CSS: Go Functional for Scaling, Performance & Simplicity&rdquo; at [Front End Camp Chicago][1]. The event was organized by the folks at [Chicago Camps][2] who do a fantastic job of putting on conferences for a great price. Check out their upcoming events at [chicagocamps.org][3].

In it I spoke about the various things I&rsquo;ve learned as I have been working in [Atomic][4], and provided [actual stats][5] from Gesture&rsquo;s CSS dating back to when I first joined the company.

You can see the slides from the talk [here][6]. Thanks to [Sergio Gomez][7] for taking the pic!

The other cool thing is that I built those slides with a new library that I created called [TweenDeck][8]. Powered by [Greensock][9], it makes easy to add custom animations to web presentations. I have open sourced TweenDeck, check out the project page on Github [here][8]. I also built a fancy little introduction animation [here][10].
