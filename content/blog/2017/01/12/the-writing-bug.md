Got bit by the writing bug. 

First, after over a year of working with Functional CSS and loving it, when I read this article, I felt compelled to respond:

**[Kiss My Classname: A Counterpoint][1]**

Next, I have been experimenting with going ‘Serverless’ and decided to share what I have been learning via a tutorial and [proof-of-concept prototype][2]. The nice folks at CSS Tricks were kind enough to publish it:

**[Build a Custom CMS for a Serverless Static Site Generator][3]**
