It has been great to see the number of events, meetup groups and resources continue to grow as Chicago is coming into its own as the tech hub of the midwest.

I have just updated the site with information about the Chicago Tech Scene. Go to [chicagotechevents.com/chicago][2] to find information on resources, conferences, meetup groups, coworking spaces, investment firms and more.

To keep up on whatâ€™s happening in Chicago tech, you can also subscribe to the [Chicago Tech Events Newsletter][3] and [follow @chicagotechevnt][4]
