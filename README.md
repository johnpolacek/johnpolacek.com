Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Forked from the [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). 

Styling via [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) and [Styled System HTML](https://johnpolacek.github.io/styled-system-html/) element primitives.

Migrated from a circa 2010 Wordpress site - migration made easy by following this [How to export WordPress posts to Gatsby](https://peterakkies.net/export-wordpress-to-gatsby-markdown/) article.
